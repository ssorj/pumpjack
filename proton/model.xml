  This document specifies the API for Qpid Proton.  It is meant to
  serve as API documentation and as a reference point for concrete
  implementations.
  
  Qpid Proton is an event-driven messaging API for building clients,
  brokers, and more.  It uses the AMQP 1.0 wire protocol, so it can
  exchange messages with other components that use the same open
  internet standard.  The Proton API is available in many popular
  programming languages.

  ## Theory of operation

  Messages are transferred between connected peers over "links".  At the
  sending peer the link is called a sender.  At the receiving peer it is
  called a receiver.  Messages are sent by senders and received by
  receivers.  Links may have named "source" and "target" addresses,
  which can be used to identify the queue messages are sent to or
  received from.

  Links are established over sessions.  Sessions are established over
  connections.  Connections are generally established between two
  uniquely identified containers.  Though a connection can have multiple
  sessions, often this is not needed.  The container API allows you to
  ignore sessions unless you require them.

  The sending of a message over a link is called a delivery.  The
  message is the content sent, including all metadata such as headers
  and annotations.  The delivery is the protocol exchange associated
  with the transfer of that content.

  To indicate that a delivery is complete, either the sender or the
  receiver "settles" it.  When the other side learns that it has been
  settled, it will no longer communicate about that delivery.  The
  receiver can also indicate whether they accept or reject the message.

  Three different delivery levels or "guarantees" can be achieved:
  at-most-once, at-least-once, or exactly-once.
