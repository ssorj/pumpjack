<p>Proton sends and receives <strong>messages</strong>.  Messages are transferred
between connected peers over <strong>links</strong>.  At the sending peer the link
is called a <strong>sender</strong>.  At the receiving peer it is called a
<strong>receiver</strong>.  Messages are sent by senders and received by receivers.
Links may have named <strong>source</strong> and <strong>target addresses</strong>, which can be
used to identify the queue messages are sent to or received from.</p>

<p>Links are established over <strong>sessions</strong>.  Sessions are established
over <strong>connections</strong>.  Connections are generally established between
two uniquely identified <strong>containers</strong>.  Though a connection can have
multiple sessions, often this is not needed.  The container API allows
you to ignore sessions unless you require them.</p>

<p>A connection operates using a <strong>transport</strong>.  A transport is a network
communication channel, such as a TCP connection.</p>

<p>The sending of a message over a link is called a <strong>delivery</strong>.  The
message is the content sent, including all metadata such as headers
and annotations.  The delivery is the protocol exchange associated
with the transfer of that content.</p>

<p>To indicate that a delivery is complete, either the sender or the
receiver <strong>settles</strong> it.  When the other side learns that it has been
settled, it will no longer communicate about that delivery.  The
receiver can also indicate whether they accept or reject the message.</p>

## Containers

## Endpoints

- Lifecycle
- Local and remote state
- Options
- Error conditions

## Deliveries

- Lifecycle
- Local and remote state
- Settlement state versus delivery state

Three different levels of **delivery guarantee** can be achieved:
at-most-once, at-least-once, or exactly-once.

- [Delivery guarantees](delivery-guarantees.html)

## Sources and targets

## Messages

- Addresses: to and reply-to, correspondence to source and target
- Content parts: body, headers, and other properties

## Events and handlers

## Error handling


## Flow control

- Flow control

## Network

- Transport lifecycle, coincidence of transport and connection start
- Connect, listen, acceptor
- SASL and SSL
- [Protocol engines](protocol-engines.html)

## More topics

- Threading model, locking
- Type system
- Codec
- IO
