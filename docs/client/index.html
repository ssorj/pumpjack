<p>An imperative client API.</p>

<p><strong>Synchronous waiting (blocking) in languages with futures but not coroutines</strong></p>

<p>The endpoint-lifecycle methods <code>connect()</code>, <code>open-session()</code>,
<code>open-sender()</code>, and <code>open-receiver()</code> start their respective
operations but do not complete them.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, you won't need to wait for these to
complete since subsequent operations will internally wait as needed.
If you do need to wait explicitly, you can use
<code>&lt;endpoint&gt;.wait()</code> to block until the connect or open
operation completes.</p>

<p>All endpoints have a <code>close()</code> method that returns a waitable future
resolving to the endpoint object itself.</p>

<p>The sender <code>send()</code> method blocks until there is credit for sending.
It then sends the message and returns a future that resolves to a
<code>tracker</code> object when the delivery at the remote peer is confirmed.
<code>try-send()</code> is a variant that instead of blocking returns null if
there is no credit.</p>

<p>The receiver <code>receive()</code> method blocks until a delivery is available
to return.  <code>try-receive()</code> is a variant that instead returns null
if no deliveries have been received.</p>

<p>Blocking operations take optional timeout arguments.  If the timeout
is exceeded, they raise a timeout error.</p>

<p><strong>Asynchronous waiting in languages with coroutines</strong></p>

<p>As described above, a language without coroutines has blocking of
two kinds: first, the blocking the library performs inside some API
calls, and second, the blocking the API user performs when using
futures returned by the API.  For example, <code>send()</code> blocks
internally for credit and then returns a future which the API user
can use to block until delivery is confirmed.</p>

<p>For languages that do support coroutines, this somewhat tactical
division is not desirable.  Here we outline the differences we would
expect to see in a rendering of this API in a language with
coroutines.</p>

<p>In general, any operation that returns a future instead returns an
awaitable task.  This applies to the endpoint <code>wait()</code> and
<code>close()</code> operations.</p>

<p>The sender <code>send()</code> method does not block the API thread for credit.
Instead, it returns an awaitable task that itself waits
asynchronously for both credit and confirmation of delivery.  There
is no <code>try-send()</code> variant.</p>

<p>The receiver <code>receive()</code> method does not block the API thread until
a delivery arrives.  Instead, it returns an awaitable task that gets
the next delivery.  There is no <code>try-receive()</code> variant.</p>

<p>Alternative method definitions for languages with coroutines are
prefixed with <code>(async)</code> in the API reference.  In an implementation,
the prefixes would be omitted.</p>
