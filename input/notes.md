# Notes

## Dynamic nodes

 - A receiving link with a "dynamic source", that is one with no
    source name supplied but with the dynamic flag set to true.

    - How to set the properties for a node that is not directly
      configured but rather created on demand?

 - dynamic-node-properties is a property on an AMQP terminus
